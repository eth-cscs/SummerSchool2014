This sample shows the difference between ArrayOfStructures and StructursOfArrays.
Kernel turns red, green and blue channels of image into grayscale.

Input number of pixels (the image is not loaded or generated, because this code is only to measure performance)
The result numbers are AoS and SoA execution time. Difference is about 25%

coalescing.cu represents non-optimal data access pattern. It is proposed to restructure data in order to match coalescing conditions (or contiguous caching conditions)
coalescing_res.cu contains updated code with optimized data access pattern.
coalescing_comp.cu contains both of variants to compare performance.
